## 🔹 Sending Custom Metrics to Datadog

### ✅ Prerequisites
1. A **Datadog account**.
2. Datadog Agent installed and configured on your system.
3. API Key from Datadog.

### 🔧 Steps to Send Custom Metrics

#### 1️⃣ Using the DogStatsD Library
DogStatsD is a statsd-compatible metric aggregator that **sends custom metrics** to Datadog.

- Install the **Datadog Python library**:
  ```bash
  pip install datadog
  ```
- Create a Python script to send metrics:
  ```python
  from datadog import initialize, statsd

  options = {
      'statsd_host': '127.0.0.1',
      'statsd_port': 8125
  }

  initialize(**options)

  # Sending a custom metric
  statsd.gauge('my.custom.metric', 42)
  ```

#### 2️⃣ Sending Custom Metrics via API

- Use the Datadog API to send metrics:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/series" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -H "DD-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
       -d '{ "series" : [{"metric":"custom.metric.example","points":[[1629384000, 20]],"type":"gauge","host":"my-host"}]}'
  ```
